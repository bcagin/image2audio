# Image2Audio

Image2Audio is an innovative project that transforms images into audio representations. This project is part of my master's thesis at the University of Padua (UNIPD) in the MSc in ICT for Internet and Multimedia. The goal is to develop a system that can analyze visual content and generate corresponding audio descriptions, offering new ways to perceive images for visually impaired users or for enhancing media accessibility.

## Features

- **Image-to-Audio Conversion**: Transforms images into audio descriptions using machine learning and image recognition techniques.
- **Real-time Processing**: Processes images in real-time and outputs corresponding audio.
- **Customizable Audio Output**: Users can customize the audio output based on different settings like tone, speed, and pitch.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Utilizes pre-trained models for image recognition to accurately describe objects and scenes.
